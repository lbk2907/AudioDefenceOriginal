"""Build Audio Defence into an executable with PyInstaller.

Double-click this file, or run py compiler.py with nothing after it, and it offers a numbered menu of
builds, then waits for Enter at the end so you can hear how it went.  Its first choice is the release
build.  Every other choice is one of these flags, which still work typed out:

    py compiler.py --test         build, then start the result and check its log
    py compiler.py --no-package   the folder alone, without the release zip
    py compiler.py --clean        empty PyInstaller's cache first
    py compiler.py --console      keep a console window, to see why the game will not start
    py compiler.py --onefile      a single executable instead (unpacks itself at every launch)
    py compiler.py --no-game      leave the game's data out
    py compiler.py --dry-run      say what a build would do, build nothing

A build makes one folder, dist\\AudioDefenceOriginal, with the game's data copied in, and ends by
zipping it into dist\\AudioDefenceOriginal-Win-<VERSION>.zip, which is what a release's asset is.

On the Mac (uv run compiler.py) the same folder holds AudioDefenceOriginal.app, with the game's data
inside the app rather than beside it, and the zip is dist/AudioDefenceOriginalMac-<VERSION>.zip. Both zips
go on the same release, named so that each platform's can be told from the other (see ARCHIVE_PREFIXES in
audiodefence/platform/host.py).

The release build - no flags at all - also files the changelog first: the lines under "unrelease:" go
under this version's heading in the repository's changelog.txt, and the copy beside the executable opens
on that version.  Every build ends by saying whether there is anything to commit.  Run with no flags and no
keyboard (from a script), it is the release build straight away, without the menu.

The port, the HRTF, the vendored DLLs and the version - read from VERSION in the repository - go inside
the build; the game's own files do not - they are copied next to the executable, where
audiodefence/paths.py looks for them when frozen.  See the README.
