"""PORT ADDITION: which operating system the port is running on, decided once.

The port was written for Windows, and it runs on the Mac as well.  Every choice that differs between
the two - the OpenAL Soft library, what speaks, where the settings live, the SDL library the controller
code reaches past pygame, the key that quits - is decided here or by the module this names, so the
game itself never asks ``sys.platform``.

Windows and Mac, one for one:

=================================  ==========================================
Windows                            Mac
=================================  ==========================================
``vendor/openal/soft_oal.dll``     ``vendor/openal-mac/libopenal.dylib`` (the same OpenAL Soft)
NVDA, Prism, SAPI 5                VoiceOver, then the system voice (platform/macspeech.py)
``%APPDATA%\\AudioDefence``         ``~/Library/Application Support/AudioDefence``
``SDL2.dll`` beside pygame         ``libSDL2-2.0.0.dylib`` in pygame's ``.dylibs``
``AudioDefence.exe``               ``AudioDefence.app``
Alt+F4                             Cmd+Q
