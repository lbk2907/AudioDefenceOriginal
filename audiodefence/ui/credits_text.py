ABOUT_TEXT = 'Remember, using headphones at excessive volume can injure your ears.\n\nAudio Defence: Zombie Arena uses binaural audio to render a 3D world using only sound. You play with your ears, so you’ll need headphones - any old pair will do, just make sure you wear the right way in the right ears.\n\nFor the most immersive experience we recommend Gyro Mode: stand up and  point the device in the direction you want to aim and you’ll hear the game world turn with you. If that’s not practical for you, try Swipe mode, where you drag your finger left or right on the screen to turn, or Tilt mode, where you tilt your device sideways to turn in either direction.\n\nAlso for a more immersive experience, we recommend Gesture mode, which will allow you to play without having to worry about button placement on the screen.\n\nYou can configure your Aiming and Layout options in the Settings menu and anytime in game by pausing it.'

#: PORT ADDITION: the nib's credits name everyone who made the game, and the game's own website, but never
#: the studio.  This goes above them, so the screen says whose game it is before it says who made it.

#: PORT ADDITION: who made the Windows and Mac port, in the shape the original's credits use - the role, then the
#: names under it.  It is a text view of its own, read after the original's, so nobody has to walk through
#: the whole cast to reach it or past it.

Built from the game's own code, method by method. The game itself - its audio, its writing, its design -
is Somethin' Else's, and this port only carries it to a keyboard."""
