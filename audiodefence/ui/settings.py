-[ADSettingsViewController addControlSchemePanel] 0x1000af5b8 builds the accessible control scheme while
VoiceOver runs, posts UIAccessibilityScreenChangedNotification with its table and centres its view on the
settings nib's controlSchemeView.

PORT UI: the original's accessible table is one long list under "Aiming", "Controls" and "Sound" headings
(its sighted twin, ADControlSchemeViewController, has those three as tabs).  The port shows one heading at a
time - the screen opens inside Aiming, and the arrows the menu navigation is not using change category, as
the armory's tabs do - and adds two categories' worth of things the accessible table never had: the turn
sensitivity (a sighted-only slider in the original) and the key bindings (the port's own, since the original
is touch driven).  Every change is spoken.
